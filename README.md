# LoRaWAN for Agricultural Sensors
General NSF research grant goals: 
The aim of the overall research project is to develop LoRaWAN communications for agricultural sensors. 
LoRaWAN is becoming a standard long distance (up 13 km) communication method for sensors on farms 
in remote locations. This project will work to interface custom LoRaWAN modules with a LoRaWAN 
installation at the UF/IFAS NFREC IoT4Ag agricultural testbed site in Quincy, FL. This project builds on a 
prior senior design project which developed custom LoRa radio modules and codes for communication 
of sensor data. There will be strong collaboration with this project and sensor communications required 
for multiple IoT4Ag projects. Careful measurement of the LoRaWAN communications performance in 
the field is a deliverable of this project.  
 
Specific Goals for this student Design 2 research project: 
In this Design 2 research project, the student will deploy a custom PCB board and provide working 
software that combines a 3rd generation particle industries processor module (Argon or Boron), a 
LoRaWAN long range radio module for long distance communications, and a soil sensor installed within 
a crop field and/or a base station near a crop field that collects data from a MESH network of soil 
sensors. The project goal will be to demonstrate LoRaWAN modules that communicate to each other 
and exchange data to the outside world through LoRa and  a LoRaWAN base station.  
 
This project builds on LoRa radio code and soil sensor code. A key part of the work will be using low 
power programming and power supply cycling to turn the processor and RF modules on and off, 
conserve power and extend battery life. The work on this project will be useful for multiple NSF IoT4Ag 
ERC projects in progress at the University of Florida. 
 
The project goals will be: 
• Build additional 3 LoRaWAN modules for field deployment with environmental sensors. 
• Repackage the existing and the new LoRaWAN units to be ruggedized for use in the field. 
• Demonstrate LoRaWAN modules reporting data to the LoRaWAN base station in the Quincy, FL 
IFAS agricultural research station. 
• Characterize the transmission distance, data rate and power consumption of the LoRaWAN 
modules   
• Add solar power and/or a battery power supply capable of running the LoRaWAN modules for 
six months.
